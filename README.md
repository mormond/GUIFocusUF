# GUIFocusUF

This is a .NET Core WPF app based on the webcam command line tool "FocusUF" created by Chris Miller

https://github.com/anotherlab/FocusUF

It allows you to override the auto focus / exposure settings on a webcam interactively.

The UI is currently "under construction".

Settings are defined in app.xaml:
 - CameraName: The name of the camera to control
 - DefaultFocus: Focus value set when "reset" button pressed
 - DefaultExposure: Exposure value set when "reset" button pressed
